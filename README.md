## Setup Instructions

### Prerequisites
- Node.js 18+, Python 3.11+, Docker
- Firebase CLI: `npm install -g firebase-tools`
- Google Cloud SDK
- OpenAI API key

### Firebase/GCP Credentials

1. **Create Firebase project** at https://console.firebase.google.com/
2. Enable Authentication (Email/Password)
3. Create custom Firestore database
4. Get Firebase config from Project Settings
5. Download service account key ‚Üí save as `backend/serviceAccountKey.json`
6. Enable Cloud Run API in GCP

### Required Secrets & Configuration Files

‚ö†Ô∏è **CRITICAL: Never commit these files to git! They contain sensitive credentials.**

**Backend Service Account Keys (2 files required):**

1. **`backend/serviceAccountKey.json`** - Main Firebase Admin SDK credentials
   - Download from Firebase Console ‚Üí Project Settings ‚Üí Service Accounts ‚Üí Generate New Private Key
   - Used for local development and Firebase Admin SDK initialization

2. **`backend/kai-developer-test-6xxxxx4.json`** - GCP Service Account for Cloud Run
   - Download from GCP Console ‚Üí IAM & Admin ‚Üí Service Accounts ‚Üí Create/Select Account ‚Üí Keys
   - This file is bundled in the Docker image for Cloud Run deployment
   - **Security Note**: In production, use [Workload Identity](https://cloud.google.com/run/docs/securing/service-identity) instead of bundling keys

**Backend Environment Variables (`backend/.env`):**

Create a `.env` file in the `backend/` directory (see `.env.example`):
```bash
OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-your-openai-api-key-here
FIRESTORE_DATABASE_ID=your-firestore-database-name
PROJECT_ID=your-gcp-project-id
```

**Frontend Environment Variables (`frontend/.env.local`):**

Create a `.env.local` file in the `frontend/` directory (see `.env.local.example`):
```bash
NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL=http://localhost:8000
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_API_KEY=your-firebase-api-key
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN=your-project.firebaseapp.com
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID=your-project-id
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_STORAGE_BUCKET=your-project.appspot.com
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID=your-sender-id
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_APP_ID=your-app-id
```

**How to obtain these credentials:**
- **Firebase Config**: Firebase Console ‚Üí Project Settings ‚Üí General ‚Üí Your apps ‚Üí SDK setup and configuration
- **OpenAI API Key**: https://platform.openai.com/api-keys
- **Firestore Database ID**: Firebase Console ‚Üí Firestore Database ‚Üí Database name (usually "(default)")
- **Service Account Keys**: See steps 5-6 above

### Local Setup

**Backend:**
```bash
cd backend
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # Windows: venv\Scripts\activate 
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Copy .env.example to .env and add:
# OPENAI_API_KEY=your-key
# FIRESTORE_DATABASE_ID=your-db-name
# PROJECT_ID=your-project-id

uvicorn main:app --reload # Runs on http://localhost:8000
#or
python main.py  # Runs on http://localhost:8000
```

**Frontend:**
```bash
cd frontend
npm install

# Copy .env.local.example to .env.local and add Firebase config
# NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL=http://localhost:8000

npm run dev  # Runs on http://localhost:3000
```

### Deployment

```bash
# Windows
.\deploy_all.ps1

# Linux/Mac
./deploy_all.sh
```

## Design Decisions & Trade-offs

**1. BackgroundTasks vs Cloud Tasks**
- Used FastAPI BackgroundTasks for simplicity
- Trade-off: Jobs lost on restart (fine for demo, would use Cloud Tasks in production)

**2. Firestore vs SQL**
- Chose Firestore for Firebase integration and no server management
- Trade-off: Limited querying vs SQL

**3. Enhanced Response Format**
- Added sentiment scores (positiveScore, neutralScore, negativeScore) beyond requirements
- Better UX with progress bars, minimal cost increase

**4. Manual Refresh**
- Users click refresh instead of real-time updates
- Trade-off: Simpler implementation, slightly worse UX

**5. Service Account in Container**
- Bundled JSON in Docker image for simple deployment
- Trade-off: Security risk (mitigated by private registry), would use Workload Identity in production

---

## Project Timeline

**Total: ~8-10 hours**

1. Setup & Learning (0.5h) - Next.js 14, Firebase, Docker
2. Backend (2.5h) - FastAPI, OpenAI integration, async jobs
3. Frontend (3h) - Auth, dashboard, job display, styling
4. Deployment (1.5h) - Cloud Run, Firebase Hosting, scripts
5. Bug Fixes (1h) - Version conflicts, CORS, testing

---

## AI Assistant Usage

Used Claude Code extensively (~60-70% of code):

**Code Generation (40%)**
- FastAPI routes, Pydantic models, React components
- Deployment scripts, TypeScript interfaces

**Debugging (30%)**
- Fixed OpenAI/httpx version conflict
- Diagnosed Cloud Run errors
- Resolved CORS issues

**Architecture (20%)**
- Suggested BackgroundTasks pattern
- Security best practices
- Error handling with retries

**Learning (10%)**
- Next.js 14 App Router patterns
- OpenAI structured output
- Documentation

**Impact**: 3-4x faster development. What would take 30-40 hours took ~10 hours. Critical thinking still required for testing, business logic, and architectural decisions.
